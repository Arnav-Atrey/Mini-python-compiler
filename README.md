# Mini-python-compiler

This is a mini python compiler program that uses ply library to classify if a given piece of code is having correct syntax or not. It checks the syntax for opening and closing .txt file statements, lambda functions, function declarations, for loops and try and except statements

There is more scope for improvement for this. For example the piece of code for syntax testing can be written in a .txt file and can be read in the compiler program instead of hardcoding it in the compiler program itself
